First, let's outline the main classes, functions, and methods we'll use:

1. `main.py`: This will be the entry point for our FastAPI application. It will contain the initialization and running of the FastAPI application, the configuration to serve static files, and the API route for the About page content.

2. `index.html`: This is the homepage of our application. We'll update it to include a navigation link to the About page.

3. `about.html`: This will be the About page of our application. It will contain sections for the Vision Statement, Mission Statement, and Director's Message.

4. `styles.css`: This will contain the CSS styles for our application, ensuring a consistent look and feel across both the index and About pages.

Now, let's create the code for each file:

`frontend/index.html`
