The architecture will be divided into two main parts: the frontend and the backend. The frontend will be a simple HTML page, while the backend will be a FastAPI application.

The frontend will have the following files:
- index.html (the main page)
- about.html (the about page)

The backend will have the following files:
- app.py (the entry point of the FastAPI application)
- requirements.txt (the list of Python dependencies)

I will also create a run.sh file to start the backend server and open the frontend in a web browser.

Let's start with the frontend files.

index.html
